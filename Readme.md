Collection of exercises 42* rank 2

If the exercise requires a function you will find the coresponding main in the source-folder of its level and they will have to be compiled seperately (with the corresponding prototype).

Example compilation level_1: gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror main_ft_swap.c ft_swap/ft_swap.c

This can avoid some mistakes as this way you are making sure the function does work propery. Also, never push these mains if you are in examen.

In case of a program, the main is obviously included.

When copiling, never forget to use the flags (you may have some small failure which the flags would pick up on).

Please make sure that you understand the code and check it thoroughly as I may have some small bugs (4now).
