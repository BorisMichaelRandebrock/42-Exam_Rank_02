Collection of exercises 42* rank 2

If the exercise requires a function you will find the coresponding main in the folder of its current level and they will have to be compiled seperately (with the prototype on top).
This avoids some avoidable mistakes as moulinette is invoking the functions this way.
Also, never push these mains.

In case of a program, the main is obviously included.

For the invocation... never forget the flags (you may have some small failure which the flags would pick up).

Example compilation of a function from inside folder level_1:
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror main_ft_swap.c ft_swap/ft_swap.c  

Please make sure that you understand the code and check it thoroughly as I may have some small bugs (4now).
